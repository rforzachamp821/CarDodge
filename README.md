***NOTE: This project is set to merge with the ZeeTerminal Commandline Program project (and at the time of reading, updates to the game may already be streaming to the project), and therefore this repository is now archived. If you would like to witness the development of this game, updates to it will be streamed through the project and release notes of the command-line interpreter will contain all the advancements in the game.

# CarDodge
A fun little terminal-based car-dodging game made for Windows, and based on the ZeeTerminal core libraries.

## About the Game

CarDodge is a game of reaction, focus and even a test of how fast you can spam a keyboard key. The aim of the game is to dodge as many suicidal Enemy Cars as you can. Each car you dodge, you get a point. 

There are levels in the game during gameplay, as well. When a specific number of points are reached, the level goes up. The game moves faster as a result, and one will need to react faster to progress further and further into the round. The border colours will change to remind you about your level increase, so you don't have to look away from your gameplay and crash as a result.

There are multiple cars to choose from, pickable from a stylish, easy-to-navigate menu. Pick the default KartCar if you're just starting out, though fancy feeling like a race driver? In that case, the GT Speed car or the XtraAero car may just be the best picks for you.

When you crash into an Enemy Car, you lose the game. The game loss screen displays the time elapsed each session, score, level, etc.

The game features a completely custom UI derived off of the ZeeTerminal core libraries (mainly the OptionSelect Engine). It also features saving your highest score in an encrypted manner, encouraging you to work to top that score to achieve better.

Fancy competing with friends, no matter where they are? Well, CarDodge is a standalone executable, so no more DLL Hell trouble. Just send the game to your friends with just one file, and compare your high scores to see who's better!

## Requirements

CarDodge requires a 120x30 cell terminal window to run. Anything less than that, and the game will report errors.

CarDodge should work on any terminal to run this game, provided it's running under Windows, supports the WIN32 Console API, and optionally supports ANSI VT Sequences.

Windows 11 and 10 are supported, both on the Windows Terminal OpenConsole.exe and ConHost.exe. The game *should* work under Windows 8.1, 8 and 7, however support is under a lower priority.
